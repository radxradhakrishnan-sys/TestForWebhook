"""Shared retry policy for outbound calls to third-party services.

Both Payment.py and SnowflakeIngest.py talk to providers that fail in bursts:
a maintenance window, a rate limit, a brief network partition. Retrying those
is correct. Retrying a validation error or a declined card is not, and doing so
turns a clean failure into duplicated work.

This module draws that line once so callers do not each invent their own.
